### Planning and Development Process
- Our team first designed our app on figma to fix on the overall flow of the app.
- We then used trello to track all our user stories and to track the different technical functionality and technical issues we encountered over the course of the project
- Communication was key to enable us to work concurrently on all the features of the app



### Unsolved problems

```
- Project and assigning bugs by project functionality
